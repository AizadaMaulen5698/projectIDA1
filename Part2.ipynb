    "This project is aimed at Exploratory Data Analysis of a dataset of crimes in Chicago from 2001 to 2017. Chicago is one of the dangerous cities with the highest number of murders of any city in the United States.Given that Chicago is a large city with many neighborhoods, it is likely that different areas of the city experience different forms of crime. In this project, we will analyze the types of crimes, crime scenes and etc."

    "Crime in Chicago has been tracked by the Chicago Police Department's Bureau of Records since the beginning of the 20th century. The city's overall crime rate, especially the violent crime rate, is higher than the US average. Chicago was responsible for nearly half of 2016's increase in homicides in the US, though the nation's crime rates remain near historic lows.[5][6][7] The reasons for the higher numbers in Chicago remain unclear. An article in The Atlantic detailed how researchers and analysts had come to no real consensus on the cause for the violence. Below is data that we will be scraped and used for our analysis:"
